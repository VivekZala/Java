This project contains java programmes from the basic to advance.

## Topics

* **Basics**
    * **Data types and variables:** Different data types available in Java and how to declare and initialize variables.

    * **Operators:** Different operators available in Java and how to use them to perform mathematical operations, logical operations, and comparisons.

    * **Control flow statements:** Different control flow statements available in Java and how to use them to control the flow of execution of code.

    * **Strings:** Strings and how to work with them in Java.
#

* **Conditional statements**
    * **If-else statements:** How to use if-else statements to make decisions in code.

    * **Switch statements:** How to use switch statements to make decisions based on the value of a variable.
#

* **Loops**
    * **For loops:** How to use for loops to iterate over a collection of elements.

    * **While loops:** How to use while loops to iterate over a block of code until a condition is met.

    * **Do-while loops:** How to use do-while loops to iterate over a block of code at least once.
#

* **Arrays**
    * How to work with arrays, which are a data structure that can store a collection of elements of the same type.
        * **1D arrays:** How to declare and initialize 1D arrays and perform operations on it.

        * **2D arrays:** How to declare and initialize 2D arrays and perform operations on it.
#

* **Methods**
    * **Methods:** Methods and how to use them to modularize code and make it more reusable.
#

* **OOPs**
    * **Classes and objects:** Classes and objects, the fundamental building blocks of Java programming.#

    * **Inheritance:** Inheritance, a way to reuse code and create more complex and sophisticated objects.

    * **Abstract classes:** Abstract classes, which cannot be instantiated but can be used as a base class for other classes.

    * **Interfaces:** Interfaces, which define a set of methods that must be implemented by any class that implements the interface.

    * **Inner classes:** Inner classes, which are classes that are nested inside other classes.
 # 

* **Static and final**
    * **Static:** Static variables and methods, which are shared by all instances of a class.

    * **Final:** Final variables and methods, which cannot be changed after they are declared.

    * **Singleton class:** Singleton classes, which can only have one instance.
#

* **Packages**
    * **Packages:** Packages, which are a way to organize code and make it easier to find and use.
#

* **Exception handling**
    * **Checked exceptions:** Checked exceptions, which must be handled or declared in code.

    * **Unchecked exceptions:** Unchecked exceptions, which do not need to be handled or declared in code.

    * **User-defined exceptions:** User-defined exceptions, which you can create to handle specific errors in code.
#

* **Multithreading**
    * **Threads:** Threads, which are lightweight processes that can run concurrently in Java.
#

* **Java lang package**
    * **Math class:** Math class, which provides a variety of mathematical functions.

    * **Reflection:** Reflection, which allows you to inspect and modify the runtime behavior of your code.
#

* **Annotations**
    * **Built-in annotations:** Built-in annotations available in Java.

    * **User-defined annotations:** User-defined annotations, which you can create to add metadata to your code.
#

* **Lambda expression**
    * **Lambda expressions:** Lambda expressions, which are a concise way to create anonymous functions.
#

* **IO**
    * **File handling:** File handling, which allows you to read and write files in Java.
#

* **Generics**
    * **Generics:** Generics, which allow you to write code that can work with different types of data.
#

* **Collections**
    * **Collections:** Collections framework, which provides a variety of classes for storing and manipulating collections of data.
#

* **Date and time**
    * **Date and time:** Date and time in Java.
#

* **Network programming**
    * **Network programming:** Network programming, which allows you to create applications that communicate over a network.
#

* **JDBC**
    * J**DBC:** JDBC, which allows you to access databases from Java.
